# Development

## Software Requirements

Aside from an editor (preferably VS Code), Git and Python, that is all you really need for this.

## IDE Configuration

### Concerning VS Code Users

If you are a user of Visual Studio Code, you'll find a VS Code configuration with tasks for setup and testing. Please use these, and, if you don't, please do not delete or edit them directly.

There are also a few selected VS Code Extensions that should help, which should come up as workspace recommendations in the VS Code extension tab.

### Terminal Locations

Just a practical note, it helps to have the terminal navigated to the root of the project for running code. It may not otherwise work.

### Important note about the website
If working on the website in the docs folder, please <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> (vscode open folder shortcut) into the docs folder.

## Code Style

Please refer to the following documents for code styles.

| Language    | Style File                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Python      | [admin/python.md](admin/style/python.md) |
